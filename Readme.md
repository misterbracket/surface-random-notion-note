# Surface Random Notion Notes

## Introduction

This little utility will show you random note that you took in Notion. You can decide which databases you want to use.

## Usage

You can use `npx` to run this utility.

```bash
npx @maxklammer/surface-random-notion-note
```

Alternatively you can install this utility globally.

```bash
npm i -g @maxklammer/surface-random-notion-note

// To run the utility
 surface
 // or
 surface-random-notion-note

```

## Configuration

You need to add an integration your notion account and share the pages that contain the databases with the integration.
The token can be put in a file for save keeping.

If you prefer to store you notion integration key in a file you can place it in your terminal rc file of your choice. This might be `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`, depending on the shell you use.
